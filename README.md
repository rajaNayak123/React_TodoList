# TodoList &nbsp; 🧾

### About Project 👇
<p>
    In this project, i created a to-do app to understand the basics of ReactJS and "Context API". I working with function based components in this application and use the Tailwind CSS to style the components. This to-do list can add new tasks we can also delete the tasks by clicking on them. The logic is handled by a click event handler whenever the user clicks on a task it gets deleted from the list.
